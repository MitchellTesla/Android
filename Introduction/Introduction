Android - is a mobile operating system that is based on a modified version of Linux.
Most of the Android code was released under the open source Apache License.


Architecture of Android
The Android OS is roughly divided into five sections in four main layers:

Linux kernel - This is the kernel on which Android is based.
Libraries - These contain all the code that provides the main features of an Android OS.
Android runtime - At the same layer as the libraries, the Android runtime provides a set of core libraries that enable developers to write Android apps using the Java programming language.
Application framework - Exposes the various capabilities of the Android OS to application developers so that they can make use of them in their applications.
Applications - Applications that ship with the Android device, as well as applications that you download and install from the Android Market. Any applications that you write are located at this layer.
