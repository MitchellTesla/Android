Resource files are stored in various subdirectories based on their type under /res folder.

Folder
Here are some important subdirectories in the /res folder and the types of resources they host:

anim: Compiled animation files
drawable: Bitmaps
layout: UI and view definitions
values: Arrays, colors, dimensions, strings, and styles
xml: Compiled arbitrary XML files
raw: Noncompiled raw files



 

Note
The resource compiler in the Android Asset Packaging Tool (AAPT) compiles all the resources except the raw resources and places them into the final .apk file.
apk stands for Android package.

This .apk file, which contains the Android application's code and resources, correlates to Java's .jar file.

The .apk file is what gets installed onto the device.

XML resource parser allows resource names such as hello-string, but you will see a compile-time error in R.java. You can fix this by renaming your resource hello_string.

Resources Directory Structure
The following code offers a quick look at the overall resources directory structure.

/res/values/strings.xml
/res/values/colors.xml
/res/values/dimens.xml
/res/values/attrs.xml
/res/values/styles.xml
/res/drawable/*.png *.jpg *.gif *.9.png
/res/anim/*.xml
/res/layout/*.xml
/res/raw/*.*
/res/xml/*.xml
/assets/*.*/*.*

Only the /assets directory can contain an arbitrary list of subdirectories. Every other directory can only have files at the level of that directory.
